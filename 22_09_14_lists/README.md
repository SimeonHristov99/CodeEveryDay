## Task 1

Write a `SortedIntersect()` function which creates and returns a list representing the intersection of two lists that are sorted in increasing order. Ideally, each list should only be traversed once. The resulting list should not contain duplicates.

```js
var first = 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3 -> 6 -> null
var second = 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> -> 6 -> null
sortedIntersect(first, second) === 1 -> 3 -> 6 -> null
```
